# Business Operations Project

## Status - In preparation

I want to make the current setup public to prepare to create an open source
project out of it.

The current implementation is working and in use, but the repository contains
internal data which has to be removed first.

Planning takes place in the
[business-operations-planning](https://github.com/bo-tech/business-operations-planning)
repository.

## About

Enabling small organizations to re-gain control over their data and
infrastructure is the main objective of the proposed project, so that they can
run their software and data based on their conditions.

Both Families and tiny businesses are considered a "Small Organization" in the
context of this project, and they have surprisingly similar needs in terms of
the underpinning infrastructure to run applications to their own conditions:
Both need backup and restore, a virtual overlay network and isolation from each
other.

This project shall turn the existing solution into a real open source project
by adding and finishing core features for the main use case and lowering the
entry bar to re-use and contribute to the existing solution of a self-sufficient
distributed platform to run applications.

Current key technologies are NixOS and Kubernetes paired up with a high degree
of automation. They have been combined so that both bootstrap from scratch and
restore from backup are only two command calls away.
