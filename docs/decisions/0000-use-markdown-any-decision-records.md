# 0000 Use Markdown Any Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record any decisions made in this project independent whether
decisions concern the architecture ("architectural decision record"), the code,
or other fields. Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 3.0.0 – The Markdown Any Decision Records
* [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) – The first incarnation of the term "ADR"
* [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) – The Y-Statements
* Other templates listed at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>
* Formless – No conventions for file format and structure

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 3.0.0" with a focus on a very simple template.
